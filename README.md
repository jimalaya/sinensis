# 🍃 SINENSIS 🍃
Sinensis is a wellness app, focused on handing the user diverse activities to reduce stress. It is not meant to replace psychological treatment, but it offers day to day solutions for anyone suffering from anxiety and depression. 

It was developed in Android Studio, particularly in Java, with XML features.

The app asks for the user's data the first time it is opened, with a simple personality and mood questionaire to map out customized activities thought to reduce anxiety and stress. The data is stored from then on.

You can also choose from three "mentors", wich act as packages of activities to select the general focus of them.

Certain activities are unlocked by using the app daily. It also features a calendar, and the user has the option to schedule certain activities, and synchronize them with the outer calendar of the mobile. Aditionally, some of them open up google maps and search for a particular recommended place in the nearby area where you can do the activity. 

The team consists in Paula Gallejones, Ines Acebes and Jimena Díaz, for the assignment of Mobile Applications, in the University Carlos III of Madrid.
